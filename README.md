# Project-2---World-Happiness-Scores

Here's a breakdown of each attribute in the dataset:

Country: The name of the country.

Region: The region to which the country belongs (e.g., Western Europe, North America).

Happiness Rank: The rank of the country based on its happiness score.

Happiness Score: A numerical score representing the overall happiness level of the country.

Standard Error: The standard error of the happiness score.

Economy (GDP per Capita): The country's GDP per capita, representing its economic wealth.

Family: The perceived strength of social support or family structure in the country.

Health (Life Expectancy): The average life expectancy in the country, indicating the overall health of its population.

Freedom: The degree of freedom individuals in the country have to make life choices.

Trust (Government Corruption): The level of trust in the government and perceived corruption.

Generosity: The perceived generosity of the population, often measured by charitable donations or helping strangers.

Dystopia Residual: A theoretical construct representing the extent to which the country's happiness score is higher or lower than what could be predicted by the other factors.

Objective Statement:

"To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset, exploring the factors influencing happiness levels across countries and regions. The objective is to identify patterns and correlations between various attributes such as GDP per capita, social support, freedom, and perceived corruption, to gain insights into the determinants of happiness."

Inference:

"From the provided dataset, it appears that countries in Western Europe tend to dominate the top ranks in terms of happiness scores, followed by countries in North America and Australia/New Zealand. Factors such as high GDP per capita, strong social support systems, and greater freedom to make life choices contribute positively to overall happiness levels. However, it's noteworthy that perceived government corruption and generosity also play significant roles in influencing happiness levels, with lower levels of corruption and higher generosity contributing to higher happiness scores."

Based on the findings from the analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset, several key conclusions can be drawn:

Economic Prosperity and Happiness: The countries with the highest GDP per capita, such as Qatar, Luxembourg, and Kuwait, tend to have higher happiness scores. This suggests a positive relationship between economic prosperity and overall happiness levels, indicating that wealthier nations are often associated with greater well-being.

Health and Life Expectancy: Regions with higher average life expectancy rates, such as Hong Kong, Japan, and Iceland, demonstrate a correlation between health outcomes and happiness. Countries with longer life expectancies may provide better healthcare systems and overall quality of life, contributing to higher happiness levels among their populations.

Generosity and Social Cohesion: Myanmar, Thailand, and Malta exhibit higher levels of generosity, indicating a strong sense of social cohesion and willingness to help others within these societies. Generosity can foster social connections and contribute to a sense of community, which may positively impact overall happiness.

Trust in Government and Perceived Corruption: The finding that Rwanda has the highest level of trust in the government and perceived corruption highlights the importance of governance in shaping citizens' happiness. Trustworthy and transparent governance can foster social stability and confidence in public institutions, which are essential for overall well-being.

Regional Disparities in Generosity: Southeast Asia shows the highest level of generosity, while Western Europe exhibits the lowest. These regional disparities may reflect cultural differences, social norms, and socioeconomic factors that influence charitable behaviors and attitudes towards helping others.

Family Support and Social Networks: Sub-Saharan Africa emerges as the region with the highest family contribution, suggesting the significance of strong family networks and social support systems in contributing to happiness levels. Close-knit family structures can provide emotional support and a sense of belonging, which are essential for well-being.

Positive Relationship Between Freedom and Trust: The positive relationship between freedom and trust indicates that societies with greater freedom tend to also have higher levels of trust in their government institutions. This finding underscores the importance of democratic governance and individual liberties in fostering societal trust and happiness.

Positive Relationship Between GDP per Capita and Happiness: The positive correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores reinforces the notion that economic prosperity contributes to overall well-being. Higher income levels provide individuals with access to resources, opportunities, and a higher quality of life, which are associated with greater happiness.

Conclusion:

Overall, the findings suggest that various factors, including economic prosperity, health outcomes, social cohesion, governance quality, and individual freedoms, play crucial roles in shaping happiness levels across countries and regions. Addressing these factors through policies and initiatives aimed at promoting economic development, healthcare access, social welfare, and good governance can contribute to enhancing overall happiness and well-being on a global scale.
